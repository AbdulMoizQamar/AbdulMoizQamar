Hey there! I’m Abdul Moiz Qamar, an enthusiastic aspiring Embedded Systems Engineer and Industrial Electronics Engineer with a keen interest in embedded systems. I’m currently on an exciting journey, pursuing my Bachelor’s degree at the Institute of Industrial Electronics Engineering in Karachi, where I’m sharpening my skills in Python programming, C/C++, and working with cool embedded platforms like ESP32 and Arduino.
I’ve had the opportunity to dive into the world of automation during my internships at Baig Engineering Pvt Ltd and Mindstorm Engineering. There, I focused on designing and optimizing automation systems, which really fueled my passion for technology and innovation. I’ve gained hands-on experience with various sensors, including the R307 fingerprint sensor, and I love implementing solutions using libraries like Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor and LiquidCrystal_I2C.
I thrive on tackling innovative projects that challenge my problem-solving skills and allow me to think outside the box. Here are a few projects I’m particularly proud of:
Multicell Phone Charging Booth: I developed a charging booth that not only provides power but also ensures security with biometric authentication and features a cloud-based billing system.
IoT Based Smart Water Pump Controller: I created a smart water management system using ESP8266 and the Blynk App, making it easier to monitor and control water levels.
Solar Panel Tracking Device: I designed a system that optimizes solar energy generation by intelligently tracking the sun’s position throughout the day.
I’m eager to collaborate on exciting projects here on GitHub and to learn from the amazing community.
